> Anticloud-hardened packaging of the upstream project `EVALS` in category **ACADEMIA RD**. Upstream source is vendored in `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` at the pinned commit below; the 12-improvement overlay lives in `anticloud/`. Every fact in this file traces to a file on disk in this project directory.

**Category:** ACADEMIA RD · **Upstream:** https://github.com/the-anticloud/anticloud-evals.git · **Upstream pin:** `a2cba60c237092eb48e3ace70913a8e5806c5ab4` · **Vendor:** Anticloud FZ LLE

# Overview

verifiers is our library for creating environments to train and evaluate LLMs.

verifiers is tightly integrated with the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), as well as our training framework [prime-rl](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) and our [Hosted Training](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/training) platform.

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Prime CLI](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime) to interact with the environments.

```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# install the prime CLI
uv tool install prime
```

## Further reading

- The [docs](docs/) contain short, human-written guides and overviews about the architecture.
- The [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [skills](skills/) are for coding agents and go into more details.

## Installation

We recommend installing the [Prime CLI](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime) to interact with the environments.

```bash

*Section quoted from the upstream readme.*
Overlay install (this project):

```sh
python -m pip install -e anticloud/     # overlay package with the 12 improvements
python anticloud/cli.py --help          # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
```

---

## Usage

No usage section was found in the upstream readme. Entry points detected in this project directory:

```sh
python -m evals    # module entry point, when the package layout matches
```

Anticloud overlay CLI (available in every project):

```sh
python anticloud/cli.py --help     # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
python anticloud/cli.py checks     # run the 16-check suite
```

---

## API

The upstream API surface is defined by the `EVALS` source tree vendored in `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` (Python ecosystem). Public entry points:

- Source modules: `assets/`, `configs/`, `environments/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, `skills/`, `tests/`, `verifiers/`
- The snapshot declares 50 dependency references across 2 ecosystem(s); see Dependencies below.
- Overlay API: `anticloud/cli.py` exposes 13 subcommands with JSON stdout; `anticloud/bench/runner.py` runs the 16-check suite; `anticloud/provenance/chain.py` exposes the SHA3-256 + Ed25519 provenance chain.

## Configuration

verifiers is tightly integrated with the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), as well as our training framework [prime-rl](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) and our [Hosted Training](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/training) platform.

*Section quoted from the upstream readme.*
Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

---

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `EVALS` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`b832033489a89fa0ee574eeadbd05a45c573da0a5420dc6b8399f9c75f9e2c93`.

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
